    <h1>Storytelling Voices</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Write a Simple Story</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <h3>The Lost Kite</h3>
        <p>On a sunny afternoon, a little boy named Tom was flying his bright red kite in the park. The wind was strong, and the kite soared higher and higher. Suddenly, the string snapped, and the kite drifted away. Tom ran after it, but it landed on a tall tree.</p>
        <p>Just as Tom was about to give up, a friendly squirrel appeared and climbed the tree. Moments later, the squirrel nudged the kite free, and it floated gently down to Tom. He smiled and thanked the squirrel before heading home with his kite.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Generate Different Voices</h2>

    <div class="story">
        <h3>1. Playful Voice</h3>
        <p>It was a super sunny afternoon, and little Tom was having the best time ever flying his shiny red kite! Whoosh! Up it went, higher and higher—until, snap! Uh-oh, the string broke, and away it floated. Tom dashed after it as fast as his tiny legs could go.</p>
        <p>“Oh no! My kite!” he cried. But just then, the coolest little squirrel appeared. “Don’t worry, buddy!” the squirrel seemed to say as it zipped up the tree. Before you knew it, the kite was back in Tom’s hands. What an adventure!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story">
        <h3>2. Dramatic Voice</h3>
        <p>The afternoon sun blazed in the sky as Tom stood in the park, clutching the string of his fiery red kite. It danced with the wind, soaring higher and higher—until disaster struck. The string snapped!</p>
        <p>Desperately, Tom chased after the kite, his heart pounding. It landed atop an immense tree, seemingly out of reach. Then, from the shadows, a brave squirrel emerged. With nimble movements, it scaled the tree and pushed the kite free. As the kite descended, Tom whispered, “Thank you.” He cradled it close, feeling a deep sense of relief.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story">
        <h3>3. Educational Voice</h3>
        <p>On a bright afternoon, Tom was flying his red kite, which rose because of strong wind currents. Unfortunately, the string, made of fragile material, broke under tension, and the kite ended up in a tree.</p>
        <p>Observing the situation, a squirrel instinctively climbed the tree, using its claws to maintain balance and grip. The squirrel’s intervention allowed the kite to return safely to Tom. This event highlights how animals can unknowingly assist humans, showcasing the interconnectedness of nature.</p>

                <th>Key Differences</th>
            </tr>

                <td>Focus on excitement, simple language, dialogue</td>

                <td>Teens and adults</td>
                <td>Detailed imagery, heightened emotions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Educational</td>
                <td>Neutral, factual</td>
                <td>Students or knowledge-seekers</td>
                <td>Focus on explanations, less on emotions</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step 4: Create Preferred Version</h2>
    <p>Please let me know which tone or style you prefer. Based on that, I can refine the story further!</p>
