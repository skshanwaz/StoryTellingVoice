# Storytelling Voices - Gen AI Project

This project is a web-based application designed for storytelling using generative AI technology. The webpage includes multiple sections for problem structuring, storytelling, images, audio, and chatbot interactions. The project aims to demonstrate the power of AI in creating immersive storytelling experiences.

## üåê Live Preview
You can run the project in a web browser to explore its features.

## üîß Features
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Links to navigate between different sections like problem structuring, story, images, audio, and chatbot.
- **Content Loading**: Loads HTML content dynamically into the main view.
- **Interactive Design**: Responsive layout and interactive elements for a user-friendly experience.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Leverages AI to enhance storytelling elements such as text, images, and audio.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for customization.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skshanwaz/StoryTellingVoice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd storytelling-genai
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## üåü File Structure
- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the layout.
- **styles.css**: Stylesheet for the visual design.
- **scripts.js**: JavaScript file for dynamic content loading.
- **genai.webp**: Image used in the header.
- **Additional HTML files**:
  - `Probem.html`: Problem structuring content.
  - `story.html`: Story content.
  - `image.html`: Images related to the story.
  - `audio.html`: Audio elements for storytelling.
  - `chatbot.html`: Chatbot interface.

## üìä How It Works
1. **Navigation**: Clicking on any navigation link loads the respective content dynamically into the `#target-content` div.
2. **Dynamic Loading**: The JavaScript (`scripts.js`) manages the loading of external HTML files based on the clicked link's `data-file` attribute.
